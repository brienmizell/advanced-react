# advanced-react

"Sick Fits", is a full stack online clothing store complete with real credit checkout. Users can search, sell, add to cart and checkout their favourite items.

The application has five main models — Users, Items, Orders, CartItems, and OrderItems — all of which are use relational GraphQL Queries.

The app also includes many server side bits including JWT authentication, permissions, sending email, uploading images, and charging credit cards.

In addition to building both the frontend and backend of the application, I spent time Testing the React application.
